# CSC436-Task5

## Task:

Remove the useState usage and refactor it to handle all of the components state through a useReducer hook.

The state should include:

* The current count value
* The “Number to Increment/Decrement by”
* The useReducer hook should be used to update the state whenever the buttons are clicked along with the updating of the “Number to Increment/Decrement by” value.
